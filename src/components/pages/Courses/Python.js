            Which format should I take this course in — on campus or online?
            It’s up to you! Our Remote courses offer a learning experience that
            mirrors GMTsoftware’s on-campus offerings but allow you to learn
            from the comfort of home. If you don’t live near Maitama or live in
            Abuja, have a busy travel schedule, or just want to save yourself
            the commute, a Remote course could be a good option for you, if
            available in your market. You’ll still get access to the expert
            instruction, learning resources, and support network that
            GMTsoftware is known for. If you prefer to learn Python alongside
            your peers and can make it to Maitama campus, our in-person courses
            allow you to take advantage of our beautiful classrooms and
            workspaces. Our Admissions team can advise you on the best format
            for your personal circumstances and learning style.

            Slack, our interactive classroom mirrors what you’ll encounter as
            part of the modern workforce. You’ll be able to not only share your
            screen and present your work to classmates but also collaborate in
            small groups via breakout rooms. Additionally, you can revisit
            recordings of class sessions in the future. Beyond class hours, get
            guidance, feedback, technical assistance, and more during frequent

            Yes! All of our evening courses are designed for busy professionals
            with full-time work commitments. Depending on your location, classes
            meet twice per week in the evenings or all day on Saturday. If
            you’re able to dedicate a full week to learning, we also have a
            full-time. Please keep in mind that our remote course is live
            online, which means that if you take the accelerated programme,
            you’ll be connected live with your instructor and classmates the
            whole day. You’ll be expected to spend time working on homework and
            projects outside of class each week, but the workload is designed to
            be manageable with a full-time job. If you need to miss a session or
            two, we offer resources to help you catch up. We recommend you
            discuss any planned absences with your instructor.

            data application. Showcase your skills by creating a custom app that
            pulls in third-party data with Pandas or integrates functionality
            from APIs with Flask, depending on the focus of your cohort. We
            encourage you to tackle a problem that’s related to your work or a
            passion project you’ve been meaning to carve out time for.
            Throughout the course, you’ll also complete a number of smaller
            projects designed to reinforce what you’ve learned in each unit.
