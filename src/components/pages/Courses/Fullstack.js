            Our Web Dev course is a 13-week (full-time) or 43-week (part-time)
            program that prepares you for entry-level positions in web
            development and software engineering. You’ll cover HTML, CSS,
            Bootstrap, Materialize, Javascript, jQuery, React, Node, and more,
            utilizing git and github. Students will also be taught our career
            prep curriculum and have access to our wildly energetic and positive
            career support team. The full-time course meets Monday through
            Friday, 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM GMT. The part-time course meets Tuesdays
            and Thursdays from 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM GMT, and every other Saturday
            from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM GMT. Either course has frequent homework and
            challenging assignments, and neither one is easy. However, they both
            provide a viable path to a new career in less than a year, which is
            the beauty of a software development bootcamp.

            All companies — not just Silicon Valley giants — are evolving into
            tech companies, and demand is growing steadily for software
            engineers who can creatively solve problems and implement robust,
            sustainable solutions. In fact, Harvey Nash and KPMG found that 67%
            of the tech leaders they surveyed reported an inability to acquire
            the talent they need. Regardless of your professional background,
            there's ample opportunity to carve a fulfilling — and future-proof —
            career path.

            This is a beginner-friendly program with no prerequisites, although

            new to the field or you’re looking to formalize your practice, our
            curriculum helps you gain fluency in the programming languages,
            frameworks, and libraries that modern employers demand and put them
            to work on the path to a new career in the field. Our Admissions
            team can discuss your background and learning goals to advise if
            this coding bootcamp is a good fit for you.

            Which format should I take this course in — on campus or online?
            It’s up to you! Our Remote courses offer a learning experience that
            mirrors GMTsoftware’s on-campus offerings but allow you to learn
            from the comfort of home. If you don’t live near Maitama or live in
            Abuja, have a busy travel schedule, or just want to save yourself
            the commute, a Remote course could be a good option for you, if
            available in your market. You’ll still get access to the expert
            instruction, learning resources, and support network that
            GMTsoftware is known for. If you prefer to learn alongside your
            peers and can make it to Maitama campus, our in-person courses allow
            you to take advantage of our beautiful classrooms and workspaces.
            Our Admissions team can advise you on the best format for your
            personal circumstances and learning style.

          <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6rem', fontSize: '14px' }}>
            Yes! All of our evening courses are designed for busy professionals
            with full-time work commitments. Depending on your location, classes
            meet twice per week in the evenings or all day on Saturday. If
            you’re able to dedicate a full week to learning, we also have a
            full-time. Please keep in mind that our remote course is live
            online, which means that if you take the accelerated programme,
            you’ll be connected live with your instructor and classmates the
            whole day. You’ll be expected to spend time working on homework and
            projects outside of class each week, but the workload is designed to
            be manageable with a full-time job. If you need to miss a session or
            two, we offer resources to help you catch up. We recommend you
            discuss any planned absences with your instructor.
