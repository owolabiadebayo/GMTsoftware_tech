            Which format should I take this course in — on campus or online?
            It’s up to you! Our Remote courses offer a learning experience that
            mirrors GMTsoftware’s on-campus offerings but allow you to learn
            from the comfort of home. If you don’t live near Maitama or live in
            Abuja, have a busy travel schedule, or just want to save yourself
            the commute, a Remote course could be a good option for you, if
            available in your market. You’ll still get access to the expert
            instruction, learning resources, and support network that
            GMTsoftware is known for. If you prefer to learn alongside your
            peers and can make it to Maitama campus, our in-person courses allow
            you to take advantage of our beautiful classrooms and workspaces.
            Our Admissions team can advise you on the best format for your
            personal circumstances and learning style.

          <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", fontSize: "14px" }}>
            Engage in live, online, project-based learning that’s designed to
            transform your career — from anywhere. Powered by Zoom, the major
            video conferencing tool, and the collaborative messaging platform
            Slack, our interactive classroom mirrors what you’ll encounter as
            part of the modern workforce. You’ll be able to not only share your
            screen and present your work to classmates but also collaborate in
            small groups via breakout rooms. Additionally, you can revisit
            recordings of className sessions in the future. Beyond className
            hours, get guidance, feedback, technical assistance, and more during
            frequent one-on-one check-ins and office hours.

          <summary>Can I work full-time while enroled in this course?</summary>
          <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.6rem", fontSize: "14px" }}>
            Yes! All of our evening courses are designed for busy professionals
            with full-time work commitments. Depending on your location, classes
            meet twice per week in the evenings or all day on Saturday. If
            you’re able to dedicate a full week to learning, we also have a
            full-time. Please keep in mind that our remote course is live
            online, which means that if you take the accelerated programme,
            you’ll be connected live with your instructor and classmates the
            whole day. You’ll be expected to spend time working on homework and
            projects outside of className each week, but the workload is
            designed to be manageable with a full-time job. If you need to miss
            a session or two, we offer resources to help you catch up. We
            recommend you discuss any planned absences with your instructor.
